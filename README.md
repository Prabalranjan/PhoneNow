Power BI Dashboard for Claire's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The goal of this Power BI project is to design and develop an interactive dashboard for Claire that effectively presents and analyzes the relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics from the dataset. The dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview of performance and enable informed decision-making.

The dashboard will incorporate a visually appealing and intuitive layout, ensuring that Claire can easily navigate and understand the presented data. It will be customized to suit Claire's specific requirements and preferences, reflecting her unique business needs.

To capture the key aspects of performance, the dashboard will encompass a range of KPIs, such as overall customer satisfaction, overall calls answered/abandoned, calls by time, average speed of answer, and the agent's performance quadrant based on the average handle time (talk duration) versus calls answered.

By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, the dashboard will enable Claire to interact with the data dynamically. She will have the flexibility to filter, slice, and drill down into the information to gain deeper insights. This interactivity will empower Claire to identify trends, patterns, and outliers, aiding in identifying areas of improvement and optimizing performance.

In addition to the core KPIs mentioned, the project encourages creative exploration and visualization techniques to enhance data representation. This includes the utilization of appropriate charts, graphs, and visuals that best represent the underlying metrics and provide a holistic view of performance.

Through this Power BI dashboard, Claire will have a comprehensive and real-time view of her organization's performance, enabling her to make data-driven decisions, monitor progress, and take proactive steps to achieve her business goals.it is a part of project of "PWC - Power BI Virtual Case Experience" certification.
